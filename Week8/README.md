# Week 8
## Plan
- Turn an LED on and off using C++
## Work Done
- With 2 jumper wires, a 220Î© resisor, an LED and a breadboard, I created a circuit similar to this:

    <img src = "Images/IMG_3.png"
    alt = "Image"
    width = 250>

- I then wrote the code in C++ to turn the LED on and off here is it working:

    <img src = "Images/IMG_1.jpg"
    alt = "Image"
    width = 250>
    <img src = "Images/IMG_2.jpg"
    alt = "Image"
    width = 250>

## What I learnt
- Writing to files
- Creating a simple circuit
- Images in markdown (This file)
